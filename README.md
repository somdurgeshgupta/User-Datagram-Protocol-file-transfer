# User-Datagram-Protocol-file-transfer

This project is loosely based on a traditional file transfer application, the client knows which server has the file, and sends a request to that server for the given file. In this project, since you can only use UDP as the underlying transfer protocol, you should implement the reliability and congestion control for your application, i.e., you have to design a retransmission mechanism to make sure the file downloaded is exactly the same as the copy in the server. Besides when congestion arises, your application should be aware of this and take necessary measure to mitigate the situation. The scenario of which your application works is a simple “one-link-network”, i.e., two machines connected to each other with only one link. Considering this is the only scenario that is required, you can optimize your application in whatever ways you want. The only constraint is USING UDP as your transfer layer.
